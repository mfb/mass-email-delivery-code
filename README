= Weird required fields on each senators page =
In order to fix the "failures", I am going through each problem-senator's contact page to see where the issues are.  I am listing them below.

boxer - required field, Subject
lautenberg - required field, view

webb - homePhone and workPhone fields (not required, but the Form class fill_phone class was assuming the number should be split into area code and phone number, so had to fix this).

hagan - Needs a radio button filled.  RESPOND = yes.

inhofe - the ids for the form inputs are all weird (A01 for prefix, B01 for first name, C01 for last name, etc).  Had to write a special function
       for the inhofe case.

coburn - has a pesky radio-button without a label that needs to be filled in with Y or N.  I tried to fill all non-filled controls with a "Y" but that introduced some exceptions like "exception occurred control 'Clear' is ignored, hence read-only", for example on toomey
