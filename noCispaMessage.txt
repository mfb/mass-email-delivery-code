Vote NO on S. 2105, the SECURE IT Act

I am writing to you as your constituent. I strongly disagree with cybersecurity legislation that would put my privacy at risk. I am asking the Senate to vote NO on S. 2105, the SECURE IT Act, or any cybersecurity bill that infringes on my civil liberties. These bills reverse decades of consumer privacy laws, violate net neutrality, and would create a vast program of personal data sharing that would treat all internet users as criminals. The right to privacy is very important to me, and I think there are better approaches to cybersecurity.
